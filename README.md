# Kickstarting with Excel
Kickstarter analysis for Louise using Excel
## Overview of Project
I am helping Louise compare Kickstarter campaigns based on Launch Date and Funding Goals
### Purpose
I am looking for trends by filtering the Kickstarter data into "subcategory's and creating Pivot tables/charts to visualize my findings. By seperating the data to the "Theater" category, it allowed me to deselect the data that was unessential for Louise's project. I then took it one step further and singled out "Plays" as well.
## Analysis and Challenges
Some things to be considered are:
- What time of year are campaigns being started?
- What is the amount of their GOAL and whether it had any correlation to success rate?
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Depending on what time of year it is, the success rate is higher than at other times. From my analmysis, I was able to determine that the Summer months, (June, July, and August), were a great deal more successful than the rest of the year. (Probably because the weather is nicer in the Summer and people like to get out more).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Looking at the data for Kickstarter "Goals", i was trying to find a correlation between the amount asked for from investors, and the success rate of their campaigns. It is my conclusion that there really was not a considerable correlation between the two. From the chart provided, you can see that overall, the success rate rate was a bit random. I would need more analysis is needed to dive in to to determine more trends, such as location, how many investors, and how much each individual invested. (I think it was probably the investors' personal preference as to how much to invest).

## Results

I recommend to Louise to start her next campaign in July for her best chance at success.
